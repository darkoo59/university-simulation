## About The Project

<a name="#about-the-project"></a>

Welcome to University Simulation Application - an innovative application designed to facilitate comprehensive management
of university operations. This simulation software allows users to oversee various aspects of university management,
including departments, subjects, faculty members, their academic titles, scientific fields, and educational
qualifications.

<h2><b>Features in Progress</b></h2>
Currently, our project is in progress, with a dedicated team working tirelessly to enhance its functionality and
usability. While we continue to refine and expand our offerings, you can expect the following features:

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Department Management:</strong> Users can create and manage different academic departments within the university, assigning faculty and resources accordingly.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Subject Management:</strong> The application enables users to define and organize subjects or courses offered by the university, along with associated details such as curriculum, prerequisites, and faculty allocation.
    </li>
<li>
<strong>Faculty Member Profiles:</strong> Users can maintain detailed profiles of faculty members, including their academic qualifications, university titles, areas of expertise, and research interests.
</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Regular Updates:</strong> We're committed to keeping our tool up-to-date with the latest updates.
